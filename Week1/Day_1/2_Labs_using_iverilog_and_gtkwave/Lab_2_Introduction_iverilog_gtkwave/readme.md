# LAB-2: Introduction iverilog gtkwave
## *Part-1:*
Step 1: Navigate to the verilog_files directory.
#### Step 2: Load the design by executing the following command:

     iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
     
A file called a.out is created

Step 3: Execute using ./a.out, it will dump the vcd file

Click on tb good mux, inputs and outputs signal will appear drag and drop them and click on Zoom fit.
