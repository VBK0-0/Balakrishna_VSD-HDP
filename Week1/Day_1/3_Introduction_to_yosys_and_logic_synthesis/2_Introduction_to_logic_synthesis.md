## Introduction to Logic Synthesis

Logic synthesis encompasses several key processes:

1. **Translation**: This step transforms HDL code (like Verilog) into an internal representation for further processing.
   
2. **Optimization**: The design is refined to improve area, speed, and power efficiency by simplifying gate structures.

3. **Netlist Generation**: The result is a netlist that details the gates and their interconnections, ready for implementation.

### Why different flavors of gate?
