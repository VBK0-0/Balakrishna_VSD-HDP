## Fundamentals of STA(Static timing Analysis)
*Objective:*
To understand and perform Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) after synthesis, validate 
functionality, and get introduced to Static Timing Analysis (STA) concepts with practical 
experiments using OpenSTA. 

- Focus on: 
  - Setup and Hold checks 
  - Slack 
  - Clock definitions 
  - Path-based analysis 
- Deliverable: 
A one-page summary or key notes from the STA course (bullet points are fine).
