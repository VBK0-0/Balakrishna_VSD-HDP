## Post Synthesis GLS
*Objective:*
To understand and perform Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) after synthesis, validate 
functionality, and get introduced to Static Timing Analysis (STA) concepts with practical 
experiments using OpenSTA. 

Part 1 – Post-Synthesis GLS 
- Refer to this example for GLS flow and methodology: 
GLS Reference – VSD_HDP 
  - https://github.com/Ananya-KM/VSD_HDP/blob/main/Day%206.md 
- Steps: 
  1. Perform synthesis of the BabySoC design. 
  2. Run Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) using the synthesized netlist. 
  3. Compare GLS output with functional simulation output (Week 2 task). 
The results should match. 
- Deliverables:
  - Synthesis logs 
  - GLS waveform screenshots 
  - Short note confirming GLS = Functional outputs
