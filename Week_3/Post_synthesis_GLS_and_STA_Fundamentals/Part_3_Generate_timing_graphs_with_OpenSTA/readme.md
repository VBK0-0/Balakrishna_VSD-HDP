## Generate timing graphs with OpenSTA
*Objective:*
To understand and perform Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) after synthesis, validate 
functionality, and get introduced to Static Timing Analysis (STA) concepts with practical 
experiments using OpenSTA.
- Use OpenSTA for timing analysis: OpenSTA GitHub 
- https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA 
- Follow this reference script: 
  Example Script â€“ Day 19 
- https://github.com/arunkpv/vsd-hdp/blob/main/docs/Day_19.md 
- Use the Help Doc for commands and options: 
OpenSTA Documenta on (PDF) 
- https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenSTA/blob/master/doc/OpenSTA.pdf 
- Steps: 
  1. Load your synthesized netlist and constraints into OpenSTA. 
  2. Generate timing graphs (setup/hold paths, slack, etc.). 
  3. Capture at least one timing report and corresponding graph. 
- Deliverables: 
  - OpenSTA input scripts 
  - Timing reports and graphs (screenshots with your userid and timestamp clearly visible) 
  - Observations: e.g., What is the critical path? What does the slack indicate?
